        <h2>Beef stew served with bread</h2>
        <P>Spaghetti Bolognese is a classic Italian-inspired pasta dish featuring a rich, hearty meat sauce served over spaghetti. 
            The sauce is made with ground meat (usually beef), tomatoes, and a mix of vegetables and herbs, cooked slowly to bring out a deep, savory flavor. 
            It's a staple in many households and is often regarded as a comforting and satisfying meal.
