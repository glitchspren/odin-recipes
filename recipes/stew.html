        <h2>Beef stew served with bread</h2>
        <P>Beef stew is a warm, thick soup made with tender pieces of beef and soft vegetables like carrots and potatoes.
            The meat and vegetables are cooked slowly in a rich, savory gravy. It's a classic comfort food, especially for a cold day.
        </P>
        <p>Bread is a perfect partner for beef stew, often used to soak up every last bit of the tasty, thick sauce. 
            You can use a crusty loaf to dip into the stew or a softer roll to enjoy alongside it. 
            The bread adds a great contrast in texture and completes the satisfying meal.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Beef: Chuck roast or other stew meat.</li>
            <li>Vegetables: Carrots, potatoes, celery, and onions.</li>
            <li>Liquid: Beef broth, and sometimes red wine or water.</li>
            <li>Thickening agents: All-purpose flour and tomato paste.</li>
            <li>Seasonings: Garlic, bay leaves, thyme, salt, pepper, and Worcestershire sauce.</li>
            <li>Oil: Olive or vegetable oil for browning the meat and sautéing the vegetables.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the beef: Cut chuck roast or other stew meat into 1-inch cubes. 
                Season the beef generously with salt and pepper, then toss with a light coating of all-purpose flour.
            </li>
            <li>Sear the beef: Heat oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. 
                Sear the beef in batches until browned on all sides, then remove to a plate.
            </li>
            <li>Sauté the vegetables: Add chopped onions, carrots, and celery to the pot. 
                Cook until the onions have softened, about 5 to 7 minutes. Add minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.
            </li>
            <li>Deglaze the pot: Pour in some red wine (optional) or beef broth to scrape up the browned bits from the bottom of the pot. 
                This adds a lot of flavor.</li>
            <li>Add liquid and simmer: Return the beef to the pot, along with beef broth, tomato paste, Worcestershire sauce, 
                and herbs like bay leaves and thyme. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a gentle simmer.
            </li>
            <li>Slow cook: Cover the pot and let the stew simmer for 1 to 2 hours, or until the beef is tender.

            </li>
            <li>Add potatoes: Stir in the cubed potatoes and continue to simmer until the potatoes are tender, about 15 to 30 minutes.

            </li>
            <li>Thicken and serve: For a thicker gravy, mix a little cornstarch with cold water and stir it into the simmering stew. 
                Cook for a few more minutes until thickened. Remove the bay leaf before serving.
            </li>
        </ol>
