        <h2>Beef stew served with bread</h2>

        <P>Beef stew is a warm, thick soup made with tender pieces of beef and soft vegetables like carrots and potatoes.
            The meat and vegetables are cooked slowly in a rich, savory gravy. It's a classic comfort food, especially for a cold day.
        </P>
        <p>Bread is a perfect partner for beef stew, often used to soak up every last bit of the tasty, thick sauce. 
            You can use a crusty loaf to dip into the stew or a softer roll to enjoy alongside it. 
            The bread adds a great contrast in texture and completes the satisfying meal.
